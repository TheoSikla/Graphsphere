#Welcome to Graphsphere!

##A tool made for graph creation, analysis and visualization.


In order to run this project you need:
1) To download all the files and folders exactly how they are.
2) You will need a python interpreter (Python 3.6 or more) and install all the possible missing packages
   for example python-igraph etc.

and idea for code improvment or new features.
